<h1>Week 10 Recap - Hamstrings, Rings and Halfcourt Slings</h1>
<p><strong>First I want to give a shout out to Kellen who got married this past weekend. Another one bites the dust. If history is an indicator his fantasy production will significantly decline from here on out, which is good for the rest of us. Also want to recognize Ben's combines finally released. I've had multiple people reach out to me commenting on how tight his hamstrings looked. Also want to bring up that Ben thought posting it meant to the GroupMe chat, which I find hilarious. We will still be waiting for his submission to Instagram. A lot of fun games this past weekend which allowed for some good fantasy output. Only four more weeks left and the fantasy season, we're in the home stretch.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This week's Big Dick of the Week honors go to none other than your boy the Commish. Haters were saying "there's no way you can win big dick of the week honors." I replied, that's just when your fantasy team scores the most points. And they said "oh, maybe then." 10 less dollars out of my Venmo account!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smith with another dog of the week, 4th of the season. At this point I think he's literally just eating dog food. But that's probably a good thing considering how expensive groceries are now with inflation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two heavy weights battled this week in a matchup between Zac and Justin. Zac pulled ahead in the Monday night Philly game, which leaves Ryan in sole possession of first place. Four teams between Petty, Conor, Kellen, and Ben are vying for the final playoff two spots. Going to need to try some long shots and hope for the best. Ask Ryan if you need advice:</p>
