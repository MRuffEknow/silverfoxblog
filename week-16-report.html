<h1>Week 16 Recap - Playoffs Round 2</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A possible butt clencher of the year between Conor and Ryan for the final championship spot. A piss poor performace from Justin Herbet made it close down the wire. Ryan squeaked by finding himself in his first fantasy championship. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A tough loss for Ben as the #2 seed. No breakout performances and a few duds ended his 8 game win streak (possibly one of the longer streaks in league history). The commish finds himself clawing back into the championship after barely making the playoffs as the 6th seed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking a look at the consolation ladder and we find Kevin and Petty battling for last place in the final week. Everyone in the playoffs dodged some bullets as every playoff team would have lost to every loser bracket team. Unfortunate for those guys as they got hot at the wrong time. Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.  </p>
</li>
