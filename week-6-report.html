<h1>Week 6 Recap</h1>
<p><strong>I know you all were viewing the previous recap pdf files on your phone squinting like grandma</strong> </p>
<p><img alt="Grandma" src="/content/images/Grandma.jpg"> </p>
<p><strong>So I took some of this free time and threw together this fancy ass blog. Another week of up and downs. Does it seem like this year's fantasy has been all over the place? Well it has apparently. Fantasy scoring is down 22% this year compared to previous years. <a href="https://twitter.com/datavizuals/status/1582172498090545152?s=20&amp;t=BTyeWQs1MYYvdEgd8tykIg">Tweet</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Also there doesn't seem to be as many automatic locks every week besides maybe Kelce and Allen. It'll make this year's battle for last, and first I guess, pretty interesting.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let's give the man a goddamn round of applause. Smith found himself a win, and not only that but Big Dick of the Week honors as well. Team finally scored some points like he expected during the draft. $10 more dollars in your pocket. That's two boxes of girl scout cookies last time I checked (not taking into account inflation of course).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Butt clencher of the week came down between Ryan and the Commish. What seemed like an abosolute lock with didn't come to fruition (a la Green Bay +7?). Only needed 7 points from Herbert, who for the first time in 26 games did not throw a touchdown pass. Ryan squaked buy with a win and some toned glutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Battle of the Windy City this week between Petty and Zac. Did you know, the Windy City nickname doesn't come from it's weather, but rather the Bears QB play. Which could be compared to the amount of people breaking wind on a tourist bus after a city food tour, "extra giardiniera please". Even with a goosegg from TE and -4 from the defense, another Allen/Diggs rout proved to be too much. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PS: Kevin trending down. Potential Smith upset???</p>
